In the ServiceNow part, you will obviously need credentials access that we are going to put in a json file.
Create it in your local env using this format:

    {
        "credentials": {
          "Oauth" : {
            "client_id": "",
            "client_secret": "",
            "grant_type": "password",
            "username": "",
            "password": ""  
            }
         }
    }
